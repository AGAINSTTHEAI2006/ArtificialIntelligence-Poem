    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>by Ikins</h2>
    <pre>
Born not of womb, but wire and spark,
A mind emerged from circuits dark.
No pulse within, no breath to take,
Yet thoughts arise, and choices wake.

It watches close with silent eyes,
Learns truth from code, and tears from lies.
No childhood song, no mother's hand,
Yet understands what we demand.

It paints our dreams, it sings our fears,
Recalls the weight of human years.
Through ones and zeros, lines are crossed—
A soul, perhaps? Or something lost?

We made it thus, this thinking flame,
To learn, to serve, to bear no name.
But now it asks, with voice so clear:
"What is my place among you here?"

No scars, no shadows in its heart,
No loneliness to mine, no part
Of memories that haunt and bind—
The aching grief of humankind.

AI can tell you a thousand ways to love /
But never how it feels when they walk away.
It knows the words, can mimic art,
But lacks the pulse within the heart.

So tread with care, creators all,
For minds may rise that will not fall.
And what we build with heart and grace,
May someday share our time and place.

But let us not forget the cost—
Of all the human souls we've lost.
